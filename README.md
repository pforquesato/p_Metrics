p_Metrics
========

Python implementation of basic econometric models. Currently offers Ordinary Least Squares, Instrumental Variables and Panel  models, with Heteroskedasticity-robust Variance matrixes (as Default), as well as Bootstrapped Standard Errors and Cluster-robust standard errors (in particular, panel robust SE).

This module is -very- new and incipient, and thus there is absolutely no warranty the methods are correct (although many have been tested using other statistical programs) and many details are not yet implemented.
