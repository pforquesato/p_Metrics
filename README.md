p_Metrics
========

Python implementation of basic econometric models. Currently offers ordinary least squares (OLS), instrumental variables (IV) and panel models, with heteroskedasticity-robust variance matrixes (as default), as well as the possibility of bootstrapped and/or cluster-robust standard errors (and in particular, panel robust SE).

This module is -very- new and incipient, and thus there is absolutely no warranty the methods are correct (although many have been tested using other statistical programs) and many details are not yet implemented. There is also no documentation, although the code itself is heavily commented and should be easy to understand.

This is just a personal project since I grew unhappy with other open-source alternatives for microeconometrics. I put the code here in GitHub in the hopes that it might someday be useful to someone. Any mistakes, problems or tips please let me know.
