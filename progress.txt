CHANGE _p_Dummify TO CHANGE THE ATTRIBUTES DIRECTLY.

OLS:
- Regression: working.
- Non-robust SE: working.
- Robust SE: working.
- Cluster SE: working.
- Bootstrap SE: working.
- Bootstrap-cluster SE: NOT WORKING.
- OOP: check!
FIX INTERACTIONS!!

IV:
- Regression: working.
- 1st stage stats: working.
- Non-robust SE: working.
- Robust SE: working.
- Cluster SE: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- Bootstrap SE: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- Bootstrap-cluster SE: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- OOP: check!
SE GIVING NAN!!!

FE:
TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
What I want:
- Within estimator: working
- Between estimator : OUT
- First differences: working 
- Robust SE: working
- Cluster SE: OUT
- Bootstrap SE: ?
- Bootstrap-cluster SE: OUT
- Random Effects: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- OOP: check!

Basically what I need to is to apply the data transformations and call p_OLS
